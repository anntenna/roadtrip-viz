# Road Trip Data

From March 30, 2013 to September 1, 2014 my wife and son and I traveled around the US exploring cities and parks and wherever we wanted to go. I'm building a site to log our memories and such, and I'll be using D3 to explore the routes and interesting data.

This is a repo of all the geoJSON data related to the trip.

## getRoute.js

To build the geoJSON files, I hacked together a Node script that requests a route from Google, converts the returned polyline to geoJSON, and outputs a file. I'll be posting more about that on [my site](http://winstonhearn.com).
